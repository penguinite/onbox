# For the next three procs
# Given that this API is called on startup by a staggering number of clients,
# The top priority was to strike a balance between performance and storage costs
# If I wanted absolute performance, I would have embedded the sender ID of each account into the posts_tag table.
# If I wanted as little as storage cost, I would have had *no posts_tag table* at all
# Anyway, the game plan is that posts_tag records date info for every hashtag in every post.
# And we use that not just to return the number of unique posts, but also we use an extra db call to
# figure out the sender and return the number of unique accounts
