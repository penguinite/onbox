## This module provides complementary string handling functions,
## such as functions for converting various datatypes to and from
## strings (for, say, database-compatability) or it might provide
## some new functionality not in std/strutils but too useless by itself
## to justify a new module.
## 
## Also, it has some slightly faster alternatives to the proc's in std/strutils
