# src/quark/shared.nim:
## This module contains important type definitions for User, Post, PostContent and anything else we use.
## 
## Why aren't they stored in their respective modules?
## Well the issue is that it would introduce cyclic dependencies.
## For example, let's say you have a procedure in quark/posts which needs to access user data somehow.
## The preferred thing to do, for readability reasons, is to import quark/users and to just use the proc you need.
## But then, when we need to write a proc in quark/users which needs to access post data, we can't!

## TODO: Find a way to put each type in its own module.
