## This module basically acts as the assets store and it contains a quick templating library
## When compilling, we expect all of the built-in assets to be stored in the assets/ folder.
## On startup, we will load all of these and do some special operation to some modules.
## (Ie. index.html, the pothole main webpage, will need to be compiled with the built-in quick template library.)
