## This is a config file pool.
## Mummy is a multi-threaded database server, and so using global variables is a bad idea.
## The configuration file is mutable even if we do not mutate it.
## So nim demands that we either store multiple copies (by using a pool) or
## we re-write our entire config system to be compile-tme instead of run-tme.
## 
## And we can't use let instead of var, because in Nim's eyes, let is still considered a GC-unsafe global.
## I don't know why let is considered GC-unsafe, it just is.
## (Maybe someone has to send a PR to re-classify it as a GC-safe global)
## 
## With let out of the way, pools are the only thing remaining.
## So we use waterpark and create a brand new "config file" pool.
## And we just use configPool.withConnection config:
## whenever we need access to the config file.
## 
## TODO: Figure out a way to trick nim into thinking config files are non-mutable or
## send a PR to reclassify let as a GC-safe non-mutable global. (As it should have been all these years)
## 
## Note: You can also use threadvars but those are fucking horrible, and pools are way easier to use.
## SERIOUSLY, I USED THREADVARS BEFORE, ITS THE EXACT SAME THING AS A POOL BUT 90% MORE ANNOYING TO USE.
