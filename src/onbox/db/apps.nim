## Apps are a fundamental part of the Mastodon API,
## and thus they are supported at the database level.
# From Onbox
import ../strextra

import rng, db_connector/db_postgres

## In the past, apps were thought of as "temporary data"
## Meaning that if they weren't used for a week then they would be purged.
## Nowadays, Onbox doesn't do that.

## Examples of "temporary data" include:
## - sessions: Deleted if the session was last used a week ago.
## - auth codes: Deleted if the code is a day old.
##               See authCodeValid() in auth_codes.nim
## - email codes: Deleted if the code is a day old. 
##                See cleanupCodes() in email_codes.nim
