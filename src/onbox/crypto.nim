# db/crypto.nim: 
## This module provides password hashing functions, and most importantly,
## the `KDF` object that is used when processing passwords for users.
## 
## To use KDF and the password hashing functions, you simply use the `hash()` function.
## If a user requires a specific algorithm then you can provide it in the `algo` parameter
runnableExamples:
  var
    password = "Hello World!"
    salt = "SomeRandomSalt"
  
  # Hashing with PBKDF-HMAC-SHA512, 210000 iterations.
  # This is the default algorithm since May 22 2024.
  let hash1 =  hash(password, salt, PBKDF_HMAC_SHA512)
