# This controls whether or not to enable "federation"
# Federation means to share posts with other servers that speak the same protocol (ActivityPub)
# Disabling this means that posts will not automatically be shared with other servers,

# If you set this, do not change it, otherwise you will break quite a load of stuff.
#
# Assuming you set this up correctly, this feature will allow you to host an Onbox instance
# on a subdomain, but somehow let you disguise your posts as coming from whatever other
# subdomain you want.

# For example, you can set up your server on ox.example.com and make it so 
# your posts look like they come from @example.com
# 
# This is still unused however.

[storage]
# Unused config options

# Onbox supports 2 different storage mechanisms.
# "flat" storage: Uploads are handled by Onbox itself, files are stored in the filesystems
# "remote" storage: Uploads are sent to an S3-compatible server (INCOMPLETE)
#
# Which one you should use depends on how many users you're expecting, how much media you'll handle and more.
# If it's a server for you only or for a couple of users then **SECURED** flat storage is fine.
# If it's for several thousands of users or you wanna join a "media pool" such as Jortage then remote storage works.
#
# By default, Onbox uses flat storage.
type="flat"

# The user uploads directory. Any files uploaded by users will be available here.
# Provided that the storage type is set to flat
# The default value is "uploads/"
upload_folder="uploads/"

# If this option is set then Onbox will append the media it wants to the end of whatever URL you desire.
# Example:
#   With this set to "https://cdn.example.com/onbox_media/", a normal image turns from https://ox.example.com/media/IMAGE
#   into "https://cdn.example.com/onbox_media/IMAGE"
# 
# Not setting this up might make you vulnerable to exploits regarding media uploading. 
# It's safest to setup media mitigation as described here: https://webb.spiderden.org/2023/05/26/pleroma-mitigation/
# Make sure that this ends with a slash however.
#upload_uri=""

# TODO: Finish the S3 stuff.

# This will be appended on top of upload_uri (or instance:uri + "/media/")
# By default it is default_avatar.webp
default_avatar_location="default_avatar.webp"

# Controls the size limit for user uploads
# Anything higher than this size will be rejected with an error message.
# The size is in megabytes.
# By default this is 30
upload_size_limit=30

[user]
# This option controls whether to enable or disable new user registrations
# This is on by default
registrations_open=true

# This option controls whether to require administrator approval for new
# user registrations.
# This is off by default.
require_approval=false

# This option controls whether or not to require email verification for users
# before logging in or doing anything
#
# By default it's turned off, but we highly recomend that you turn this on.
# Unless you don't have a working email server, in which case, you need to
# either setup one or enable require_approval and keep track of new account requests

# It is highly recommended to set this number to something above or equal to 2000.

# The default is 2000 characters

[email]
# Whether or not email has been enabled.
#
# Note: If the require_verification option has been enabled but this hasn't.
# then you will trap your users in an infinite login loop.
# Disable require_verification or configure the email server.
# We'll tell you if you did something wrong though, no worries.
#
# Default: false
enabled=false

# Set this to the address of the email server that you use.
# There is no default, and we *will* crash if this
# is left empty whilst email is enabled.
host=""

# You should change this into the correct port for your email server
# But you could also just brute force it by trying the common ports.
#
# So, here is a list of common ports
# 25 - standard port used for plain-text, unencrypted SMTP
# 465 - non-standard port used for secure, encrypted SMTP
# 587 - standard port used for secure, encrypted SMTP
# 2525 - used as a backup port, unclear if there's encryption or not.
# See: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/smtp-port-25-587/
#
# There is no default, and we *will* crash if this isn't changed
# while email is enabled.
port=0

# You should also change this to the correct sender address
# we *will* crash if this is empty when sending emails.
from=""

# You most likely want to keep this to true.
# Or, actually, it doesn't matter for email verification codes.
# It's just better for privacy if you set this to true.
# 
# You can also set this to "starttls" if your email server uses that.
# So, here's a short summary:
# ssl="false" - Will send emails unencrypted, not recommended as it leaks information.
# ssl="true" - Will send emails encrypted, this is the default value
# ssl="startttls" - Will send emails encrypted with STARTTLS, this should be fine too. If your server supports it.
#
# Make sure to wrap this in quotes, just to be safe.
# Default: true
ssl="true"

# It is *highly* recommended that you setup authentication in your
# email server, otherwise it could be hijacked by spammers
# to send out bulk emails and get your server blocked.
#
# If you have enabled email authentication then you can add a username
# and password here, if this is empty then we will just not
# bother with authentication, we'll still try to send the message though.
