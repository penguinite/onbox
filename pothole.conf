# If you set this, do not change it, otherwise you will break quite a load of stuff.
# Assuming you set this up correctly, this feature will allow you to host a Pothole instance
# on a subdomain, but somehow let you disguise your posts as coming from whatever other

# 
# This is still unused however.

[storage]
# Unused config options

# Pothole supports 2 different storage mechanisms.
# Flat storage: Uploads are handled by Pothole's web server, and copied to the folder configured in storage:upload_folder. Set this to "flat" to enable this.
# Remote proxy: Uploads are magically sent to whatever S3-compatible server you configure. (Incomplete) Set this to "remote" and configure the server to enable this feature.
# Which one is better? Well if it's a server only for you then consider setting up Flat storage *SECURELY*
# If it's for a large server or you wanna join a "media proxy collection" then set up Remote proxy.
type="flat"

# The user uploads directory. Any files uploaded by users will be available here.
# Provided that the storage type is set to flat

# If you have implemented a system such as the one described here: https://webb.spiderden.org/2023/05/26/pleroma-mitigation/
# then you can set this url to the "media server" you have. 
# Pothole will simply append the media it seeks to the end of whatever URL to add here, so:
# https://media.example.com/pothole/ turns into https://media.example.com/pothole/user_id/media_filename/
# If this is not set, then under a default config, Pothole will use the instance:uri option + /media/ like so:
# https://ph.example.com/media/user_id/media_filename/
#upload_uri=""

# Set this to the address of the email server that you use.
# There is no default, and Pothole *will* error out if this
# is left empty whilst email is enabled.

# You should change this into the correct port for your email server
# But you could also just brute force it by trying the common ports.
#

# 25 - standard port used for unencrypted SMTP
# 465 - non-standard port used for encrypted SMTP
# 587 - standard port used for encrypted SMTP
# 2525 - used as a backup port, unclear if there's encryption or not.
# See: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/smtp-port-25-587/
#
# There is no default, and Pothole *will* error out if this isn't changed
# while email is enabled.
port=0

# You should also change this to the correct sender address
# Pothole *will* error out if this is empty when sending emails.
from=""

# You most likely want to keep this to true.
# Or, actually, it doesn't matter for email verification codes.
# It's just better for privacy if you set this to true.
# 
# You can also set this to "starttls" if your email server uses that.
# So, here's a short summary:
# ssl="false" - Will send emails unencrypted, not recommended as it leaks information.
# ssl="true" - Will send emails encrypted, this is the default value
# ssl="startttls" - Will send emails encrypted with STARTTLS, this should be fine too. If your server supports it.
#
# Make sure to wrap this in quotes, just to be safe.
# Default: true
ssl="true"

# It is *highly* recommended that you setup authentication in your
# email server, otherwise it could be hijacked by spammers
# to send out bulk emails and get your server blocked.
#
# If you have setup authentication then you can add a username
# and password here, if this is empty then Pothole will just not
# bother with authentication, it will still try to send the message though.
